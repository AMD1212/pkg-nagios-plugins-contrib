Description: Plugins for nagios compatible monitoring systems
 This package provides various plugins for Nagios compatible monitoring
 systems like Nagios and Icinga.
 It contains the following plugins:
 .
   * check_ipmi_sensor (2.3): IPMI Sensor Monitoring Plugin
     Plugin to monitor the hardware status (fan speed, temperaturs,
     voltages, power usage, ...) of a server using IPMI.
   * check_memcached (1.2): plugin to check memcached instances
     It will give a critical message if a partiular memcached host is
     inaccessible and generate a warning if the hit/miss ratio falls
     below a given threshold or the number of evictions exceeds a given
     limit.
     Hit/miss and evictions are measured over a 30 minute interval,
     using a memcached object to store the earlier statistics.
 .
 Some scripts and binaries need more packages installed to work, which is
 implemented as recommands.
